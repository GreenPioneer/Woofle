Why Use Woofle?

Woofle was created to aggregate basic visual information about dog breeds and put it in one place. Users can see pictures and watch videos about specific breeds right from the app. It was also intended to expose people to breeds or breed variations that they hadn't heard of. Users can save their favorite breeds for easy access to the relevant information later.
